After four weeks, their levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)\n",

E.g. to get only the values for the human milk HM group one has to type `Data$HDL[Data$GRP == \"HM\"]`. This notation tells R to get the values of the HDL variable from the whole dataset if it's corresponding GRP variable equals to factor value of \"HM\". The double equal sign `==` mean equals and is a logical comparison operator. It tests the values on the left and right sides against each other and returns TRUE if both of them are equal, otherwise it return FALSE."
