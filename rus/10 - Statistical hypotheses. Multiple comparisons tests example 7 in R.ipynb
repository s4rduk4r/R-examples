The mice were administered to the standard food rations with additional dietary suppplements F1, F2, F3 during the month. At the end of the study the body mass changes (BMC) were measured and garnered in a table below. Find if the effect of the body mass change is related to the specific dietary supplement.\n",

The independent variable is specified on the right side of the `~` sign and the dependent variable is provided on the left side.
